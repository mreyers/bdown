Hello! I am Matthew Reyers, an avid sports fan and Statistician in training. This website will play host to what I hope will become a collection of sports related projects, writeups, and discussions. As I slowly figure out how designing a website works, I will add sections for Code demonstrations, data sources, and other sections I find useful. There should be a little bit of everything here from across the world of sports so be sure to check in on occasion!
